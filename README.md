# üîç Explain the Difference Between `any`, `unknown`, and `never` Types in TypeScript

TypeScript has various powerful types to write the code in more safe and maintainable way.  
In this blog, I will discuss about TypeScript's `any`, `unknown`, and `never` type üëá

---

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ `any`

In TypeScript, the `any` type means declaring the variable without writing the data type of it.

- It allows a variable to hold any data type value.
- It disables TypeScript‚Äôs type checking. And increase the possibility to do runtime error.
- It is one kind of going back to JS environment by telling the compiler that developer knows what is he doing.
- Don't have to do any checks before performing operations on values of type `any`.

```
let value: any = 5;
value = "hello";        // no error
value.toUpperCase();    // no error
value = true;
```

‚úîÔ∏è *As it reduces the type safety, it‚Äôs better to avoid it. Or developer can use it if he is 100% sure of his work.*

---

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ `unknown`

In TypeScript, the `unknown` type represents a value that could be anything, just like `any`.  
But it **cannot** be used directly without checking the type first. It requires **type narrowing** before usage.

```
let value: unknown = "hello";
// value.toUpperCase(); // Error. Cannot use before type checking.

if (typeof value === "string") {
  console.log(value.toUpperCase()); // Safe
}
```

‚úîÔ∏è *It is safe to use `unknown` when expecting any type but still want type safety.*

---

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ `never`

In TypeScript, the `never` type represents values that **never occur**.  
It is typically used for functions that throw errors or never return.

```
function throwError(): never {
  throw new Error("Something went wrong!");
}

function infiniteLoop(): never {
  while (true) {}
}
```

‚úîÔ∏è *It is not used for regular variables.*

# üéØ What is the Use of Enums in TypeScript?

In TypeScript, an "enumeration" (abbreviated as enum) is a powerful feature that allows developers to define a set of named constants. This enhances code readability, organization, and type safety, especially when working with sets of related values.

---

## üìù Use of Enums

‚úÖ Improves code readability and maintainability.  
‚úÖ Prevents hardcoded strings or numbers throughout the code.  
‚úÖ Offers type safety with meaningful names.  
‚úÖ Works well in switch cases and conditional checks.

---

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ `Numeric Enums`

Numeric enums assign auto-incremented numbers by default, starting from 0 (unless a custom starting value is provided).

```
enum Direction {
  North,   // 0
  East,    // 1
  South,   // 2
  West     // 3
}

let dir: Direction = Direction.South;
console.log(dir); // Output: 2
```

---

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ `String Enums`

String enums explicitly assign string values to each member, offering more flexibility and clarity.

```
enum Days {
  Monday = "MONDAY",
  Tuesday = "TUESDAY",
  Wednesday = "WEDNESDAY",
  Thursday = "THURSDAY",
  Friday = "FRIDAY",
  Saturday = "SATURDAY",
  Sunday = "SUNDAY"
}

let today: Days = Days.Thursday;
console.log(today); // Output: "THURSDAY"
```
